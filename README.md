# Basic Datatypes in C

C is a programming language which supports a variety of Datatypes. These Datatypes are used to represent different types of values in a program.

## Integers

ntegers are whole numbers, both positive and negative. In C, there are several integer data types. The most common are:

int: Used to represent integers. Usually 32 bits on most platforms.
short: Used to represent integers that require less storage than int. Usually 16 bits on most platforms.
long: Used to represent integers that require more storage than int. Usually 32 bits or 64 bits on most platforms.

```
int num = 42;
short s = 32767;
long l = 2147483647L;
```

## Floating Point numbers

Floating-Point Numbers:
Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional part. In C, there are two floating-point data types:

float: Used to represent single-precision floating-point numbers. Usually 32 bits on most platforms.
double: Used to represent double-precision floating-point numbers. Usually 64 bits on most platforms.

```
float pi = 3.14159f;
double e = 2.71828;
```

## Characters 

Characters are single letters, digits, or symbols. In C, characters are represented using the char data type.

```
char cstr[] = "hello";
```
